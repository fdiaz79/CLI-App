# CLI-App

Welcome to my CLI-App.

With this App you will be able to get information about:
* The next concert of your favorite band
* Your favorite song
* Your favorite movie
* Or just edit a file with the action you wanna perform and execute it.

## NEXT CONCERT OF YOUR FAVORITE BAND
Just type in your terminal:
_node liri.js concert-this **your band/artist name**_

To see how it works, please click on the following link:

## YOUR FAVORITE SONG
Type in your terminal
_node liri.js spotify-this-song **your song title**_

This will populate a list with the 10 top results with the title you searched. Have in mind that if you don't type in the title of your song, the result will default to The Sign, from Ace of Base. Take a look at the video of this function:

## YOUR FAVORITE MOVIE
Type in your terminal
_node liri.js movie-this **your song title**_

if you don't type in the MOVIE NAME, the result will default to Mr. Nobody. Take a look at the video of this function:

## EDIT A FILE AND EXECUTE FROM IT
You can edit the file random.txt with any of the commands and run from the terminal
_node liri.js do-what-it-says_

these are the options to type in the file, just type in one (and only one) of the following lines:

* _concert-this,"your band/artist name"_

* _spotify-this-song,"your song title"_

* _movie-this,"your song title"_


You can even type in _do-what-it-says_ but it will result in an error message.
